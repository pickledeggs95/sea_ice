# sea_ice
Graphic visualization of retreat of arctic sea ice. Intentionally convuluted in order to get familiar with various aspects of python programming.

- run 'sea ice extent.py' first to scrape NOAA site for necessary image files. This script analyses data from images and writes a csv file.
- run 'csvreader.py' next to read csv file and generate graphic visualization of data.
